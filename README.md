Introduction

SafeSpaces is a practical solution for emergency situations which assists in locating and tracking individuals in need of assistance. Built on the Cisco Spaces API, it leverages Wi-Fi-based device location technology to maximize responsiveness. This powerful technology can help reduce human error and save lives in emergency situations. It is particularly targeted towards companies that are already using Cisco Spaces, offering them an easy, effective, and cost-efficient addition to their safety plan.
